# Gameplay
* The main goal of this season is to play with people we trust, so if you wish to invite someone, just ask the person who invited you on the server.
* We also wish that everyone plays together, which is why for a while the map limits will be restricted to 10k x 10k blocks.
* After completing a settlement near the spawn area and playing for more than 24 hours you will be able to explore as far as you wish. Just be aware that settling far is a pain in the ass to everyone and we don't encourage it.
* Any 3rd party mod or software that is not directly included in the modpack is stricly forbidden. If you wish for a mod to be added, please contact staff so it can be added to the modpack and enjoyed by all.
* This is common sense, but any cheat will result in a direct ban from the community
* If you wish to build a base or structure away from spawn, please make sure you first have a settlement at spawn. This can be a house, shop or an eventful building ~ like a decorative bar, restaurant, town hall, etc.
* Do not steal or destroy other people's stock or items.

# Community
* Be respectful ~ no insults, slurs, the classic stuff.
* If you have a problem with a player, talk with other players. There's a good chance they know the player you're having an issue with and can help you get the issue resolved. Contacting an admin for a player-to-player issue should be a last resort. We're trying to build an open culture where issues can be discussed with reason & calm.

# Build & environment
* No destruction of other people's builds or property (items, animals, etc)
* Don't detoriate the quality of the environment around other people's build or in the spawn area ~ no big holes, flattening of terrain, etc.
* Make sure to delete temporary structure ~ like skybridges built to transport animals. such builds should not be up for more than 48h
* Keep your builds politically correct generally speaking, and respectful at spawn (large cobblestone penises are allowed in bases but not at spawn)

# Economy
This was our number one mistake last season, and is therefore the most important rule for this season;

The economy should not be a profit-driven market. Basically, we're trying not to recreate capitalism inside minecraft.

While you're free to set your own prices for the ressources you sell, other players are also free to sell the same ressources as you, set different prices, etc.


But the goal isn't to have price or stock wars ~ so if you feel like someone is making a shop just to fuck with you, let us know !

It's also alright for someone to make their own farm to gather the same ressource you may sell.


To help keep the economy fair & fun, try to fill the gaps within it ~ if 4 people are selling wood already, try to sell something else.


Our economy's goal is to keep the server active, not to make people rich. If you're trying to hoard a ressource just to become "the richest person on the server", you'll be asked to stop. continuing with such behaviour will result in a community vote on a potential ban from the server.


Here a few rules for the shop:
* Generally speaking, shops should be built at spawn. We may allow exception if the ressource you're selling can only be bought in huge quantities (e.x. you own a kelp farm), but please contact staff before building a shop away from spawn
* There isn't a fixed currency for transactions, but we recommend using diamond & other ores as the primary currency. However if you wish to sell sand in exchange for dirt, feel free to do so ! Just beware other players might not have the ressource you want hand and might skip farming it for you
* There isn't any automated shop system. This means shops should specify the price of the items being sold, and make the stock available in containers. The standard way to collect payment would be users replacing the goods with the payment. ex you sell wood for 3 diamonds a stack; I buy 4 stacks from you and replace each stack with the diamonds I owe you inside the container. Shop owners are free to come up with more creative ways to sell their stock (redstone, player-to-player interactions, etc.)
* Stealing is obviously not allowed. If you underpay, or overcharge for goods, you may receive a warning. keep it fair and honest !
