# GameLab SMP - Rules

## Disclaimer
The "GameLab SMP" minecraft server is owned solely by Nicolas "itsRems" Theck, who has the right to:

* Log your in-game data
* [Ban/Kick/Unwhitelist] you from the server *without the need for a warning or explanation as to why*
* Decide wether or not new players can join, without having to give a reason.

either when you break one of the rules in this document, or by a solo admin decision, which does not have to be justified.

#### Bans

You may appeal your bans, but as mentioned above, I have the full right not to give a single fuck.

#### Guarantee

The "service" provided to you - the access to the game server - is made with zero guaranties regarding uptime, backups, functionality of the provided tools or server performance.

If any problem occurs, you are very welcome to let me know about it, but I will not necessarily take action.

## General gameplay rules
You are to respect the following rules regarding in-game behaviour:

* Respect other members' opinions, property, etc.
* Do not grief other people's bases, tunnels or other installations
* Do not engage in PvP unless you have the other parties' agreement
* Do not use other people's farms, unless you have been granted access to it by its owner
* Do not use ANY third party software other than Optifine &/or the official modpack. Feel free to add utility mods to the modpack via CurseForge, but know that these softwares are banned: [seed finders] [advanced minimaps] [waypoint mods] [any cheat]


## Plots

Regarding plots, a few rules apply:

* No claiming near spawn. This includes an area roughly 500x500 surrounding the spawn. If you're not sure you're far away, ask an admin before settling.
* Respect existing claims: do **not** claim next to an existing player's base without their consent. this action could result in an instant ban &/or clearing of all your plot (including any ressources you own inside of it)
* Do not claim POI (nether fortresses, strongholds, and other rare structures) without an admin's consent.

## Candidacies

We try to welcome new players in order to allow others to enjoy the server, and multiply the amount of large(r) scale projects on the server.

There are two ways a player can join the server:

#### 1. Application

Players wanting to become part of the GameLab SMP can fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/A23eemhD9hUtY3U46), though there is no guarantee for an answer.

#### 2. Referral
Any player with 20 (twenty) hours of **active** playtime (logged by a server tool), a perfect reputation and at least 3 (three) weeks of seniority has the ability to request the role of "Member".

Members have the right to invite up to 3 (three) new players per month into the server, with these rules:

* The referent takes **full** responsability for the referee's actions. Therefore;
* In case of a major incident caused by the referee, the referent may lose access to the GameLab SMP for either: a set amount of time; the rest of the season; forever;
* In case of a minor incident caused by the referee, the referent will be contacted by an admin, and together they will decide wether or not to remove the referee from the server, and the admin may also punish the referent, tho this will be on a case-per-case basis.

## Extra: Data
We use a multitude of tools to collect player data. This may include precise gameplay recording, logging of messages, commands and other data.

What this means for you: don't try anything stupid - I **will** find out
