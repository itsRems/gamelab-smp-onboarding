# GameLab.GG SMP - Season One // Onboarding

> If you're reading this, you're very probably a new member of our SMP - Welcome !

> This document is here to give you a short summary of how this server operates, and how to use the various Mods & Plugins provided. Feel free to come back to it at any time !


## 0. Nice to have links !
Discord server: [discord.gg/QwsFk55guz](https://discord.gg/QwsFk55guz)

Server IP / WebMap URL: [smp.gamelab.gg](https://smp.gamelab.gg)

## 1. Rules

Here's a basic set of rules to follow:

* Be nice to other players. This applies to your gameplay, chat interactions and VOIP.
* Do not engage in PvP activities with other players, unless they have agreed to do so
* Do not steal ressources from other players
* Do not claim land close to other existing claims without asking the owner of said claim beforehand. As a general rule, try to leave a few hundred blocks between you and other players (unless seperated by water)

#### The above list is non-exhaustive. Before playing, you MUST understand that the staff has every right to ban/kick/unwhitelist you from the server without giving any specific reason. This rule will usually be applied to griefers, cheaters, and unfriendly people.

## 2. The modpack

To make the in-game experience more interesting, we've decided to use a VOIP mod/plugin. This allows you to communicate with other players via voice from the game with proximity chat & voice groups. While you don't *need* to use this, it truly makes everyone's experience better.

This modpack may be required to participate in certain events on the server.

#### Required
* Java
* [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/) with minecraft setup
* The latest modpack file (see "Downloading")

#### Downloading
The latest version of the modpack can be downloaded from the `#modpack-updates` channel on our discord server. Just download the ZIP.
#### Installing
* Open CurseForge
* Go in the "minecraft" section
* Click "Create Custom Profile" top right
* Click "import" (`or import a previously created profile`)
* Select the zip you downloaded

The rest should be pretty straight forward :)

## 3. Utilities
Utility commands you can use:

* `/trigger ch_toggle` - used to turn ON/OFF a neat coordinates HUD, showing you X/Y/Z coordinates, your heading and the in-game time.

## 4. Economy
We have an economy system based around the diamond.

The idea is simple: you can deposit your diamonds in the bank to top up your balance, and withdraw them whenever you want. You can pay in shops, transfer money to other people and check your balance. The diamonds stored AND the ones in your hand can be used for purchasing at any shop.

Here's a list of the commands you should know about:

* `/deposit` - to deposit the diamonds you have in your hand
* `/deposit all` - to deposit all the diamonds in your inventory
* `/balance` or `/bank` - to see your personal balance
* `/baltop` - to check on the balance of the richest players
* `/withdraw <amount|all>` - to withdraw diamonds from the bank into your inventory
* `/pay <player> <amount>` - to pay someone
* `/bank transfer <player> <amount>` - to transfer money to another player. Similar to pay, but no taxes are applied

## 5. Claims

> We have switched claims plugin on the 25th of december. Below is the link to the official plugin documentation for players - more to come here !
